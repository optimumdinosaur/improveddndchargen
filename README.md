# Improved D&D Character Generator
An improvement over my previous efforts to make a full character generator for Dungeons and Dragons v3.5.

This one uses a modular file structure to let users easily make characters of any class, just by editing a .json file. 
The goal is to have all content just for an individual class, race, feat, etc., will be in a separate .json file and generator.py will be only care about creating characters using RAW from the core rulebooks. 
I would like for other subsystems like Psionics, Tome of Battle, and Shadowmagic to be included as well.
